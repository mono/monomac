	* I moved NSAffineTransform to Foundation and added the
	important functions. Previously it was in AppKit and lacked
	functions to actually manipulate the matrix.

	* Changed the path to CoreGraphics lib. The previous path did not
	work. New path suggested by Geoff Norton.

	* Changed NSGraphicsContext.GraphicsPort to return CGContext
	instead of IntPtr. This seems to be the correct way to get a
	CGContext and it works well.

	* appkit.cs: Apply patches from Koen to add support for the
	delegate and datasources on the NSOutlineView.
