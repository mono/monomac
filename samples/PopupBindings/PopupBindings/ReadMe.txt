PopupBindings

Converted to Mono and C# by Kenneth J. Pouncey 2010/11/18 from Apple's Sample project of the same name (Copyright (C) 2010 Apple Inc. All rights reserved.).

"PopupBindings" is a Mono C# sample application that demonstrates how to use the bindings to manage the contents and selection of the NSPopupButton class.  It uses the NSArrayController class to hold the data and track the selection.

This is done using the following NSPopupButton bindings:

The content binding describes the collection of objects. The collection is the objects in the array controller.

	Bind to: PopupList
	Controller Key: arrangedObjects
	Model Key Path: (leave blank)

The contentValues binding describes what will be displayed in the pop-up menu. In this example it will be "name" portion of the Person object. Use the following choices for the contentValues binding:

	Bind to: PopupList
	Controller Key: arrangedObjects
	Model Key Path: name

The selectedIndex binding describes the indexed selection the user chose from the menu. Use the following choices for the selectedIndex binding:

	Bind to: PopupList
	Controller Key: selectionIndex
	Model Key Path: (leave blank)

All four Form Cells describing the person's address is bound to the array controller's selection using a specific NSDictionary key.  So for the "street" Form Cell (Street), its value binding should look like:

	Bind to: PopupList
	Controller Key: selection
	Model Key Path: addressStreet


Sample Requirements
The supplied solution requires MonoMac bindings from the Mono Project.
