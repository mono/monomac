DESCRIPTION:

Texture Filters, Lighting & Keyboard Control:
=============================================
Ok, I hope you've been understanding everything up till now, because this is 
a huge tutorial. I'm going to attempt to teach you 2 new ways to filter your 
textures, simple lighting, keyboard control, and probably more :) If you 
don't feel confident with what you've learned up to this lesson, go back and 
review. Play around with the code in the other lessons. Don't rush. It's 
better to take your time and learn each lesson well, than to jump in, and only 
know enough to get things done. 

In this tutorial I'll teach you how to use three different texture filters. 
I'll teach you how to move an object using keys on the keyboard, and I'll 
also teach you how to apply simple lighting to your OpenGL scene. Lots 
covered in this tutorial, so if the previous tutorials are giving you problems, 
go back and review. It's important to have a good understanding of the basics 
before you jump into the following code.
