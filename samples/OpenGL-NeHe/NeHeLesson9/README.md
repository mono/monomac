DESCRIPTION:

Moving Bitmaps In 3D Space:
===========================

This tutorial covers a few of the topics you guys had requested. You wanted 
to know how to move the objects you've made around the screen in 3D. You 
wanted to know how to draw a bitmap to the screen, without the black part of 
the image covering up what's behind it. You wanted simple animation and more 
uses for blending. This tutorial will teach you all of that. You'll notice 
there's no spinning boxes. The previous lessons covered the basics of OpenGL. 
Each tutorial expanded on the last. This tutorial is a combination of 
everything that you have learned up till now, along with information on how 
to move your object in 3D. This tutorial is a little more advanced, so make 
sure you understand the previous lessons before you jump into this tutorial. 

Welcome to Tutorial 9. By now you should have a very good understanding of 
OpenGL. You've learned everything from setting up an OpenGL Window, to 
texture mapping a spinning object while using lighting and blending. This 
will be the first semi-advanced tutorial. You'll learn the following: Moving 
bitmaps around the screen in 3D, removing the black pixels around the bitmap 
(using blending), adding color to a black & white texture and finally you'll 
learn how to create fancy colors and simple animation by mixing different 
colored textures together.
