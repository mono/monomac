DESCRIPTION:


Your First Polygon:
===================

Using the source code from the first tutorial, we will now add code to create 
a Triangle, and a Square on the screen. I know you're probably thinking to 
yourself "a triangle and square... oh joy", but it really is a BIG deal. Just 
about everything you create in OpenGL will be created out of triangles and 
squares. If you don't understand how to create a simple little triangle in 
Three Dimensional space, you'll be completely lost down the road. So read 
through this chapter and learn.  

Once you've read through this chapter, you should understand the X axis, 
Y axis and Z axis. You will learn about translation left, right, up, down, 
into and out of the screen. You should understand how to place an object on 
the screen exactly where you want it to be. You will also learn a bit about 
the depth buffer (placing objects into the screen).

SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS

The supplied solution requires MonoMac bindings from the Mono Project.
