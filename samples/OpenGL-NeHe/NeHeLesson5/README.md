DESCRIPTION:


3D Shapes:
=============

Now that we have setup, polygons, quads, colors and rotation figured out, 
it's time to build 3D objects. We'll build the objects using polygons and 
quads. This time we'll expand on the last tutorial, and turn the triangle 
into a colorful pyramid, and turn the square into a solid cube. The pyramid 
will use blended colors, the cube will have a different color for each face.  

Building an object in 3D can be very time consuming, but the results are 
usually worth it. Your imagination is the limit!

SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS
