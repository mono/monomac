A port of the RoundedDisplayWindow sample:

http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/RoundTransparentWindow/Introduction/Intro.html

Slightly updated to avoid using the deprecated APIs in the sample.

There are two classes needed:

	* CustomWindow - Configures the Window

	* CustomView - The view contained in the window
